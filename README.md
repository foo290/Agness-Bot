## Setup :

There are some minor setting that you'd ahve to do before get going. There is a <a href='https://github.com/foo290/Agness-Bot/blob/master/AGNESS_BOT/settings.py'>settings.py</a> file in there which contains all the configurations that you need to customize the bot for your need.

There are some configurations which are server dependent, in this section, those configs are explained ...

#### 1. Roles :

A dict defining aliases for the roles you may create and for the roles the bot will use for command checks are defined in <a href='https://github.com/foo290/Agness-Bot/blob/a4066dd35ec1fbf6b018e32ebe3eadc7b5b86722/AGNESS_BOT/settings.py#L86'>ROLE_ALIASES</a> in <a href='https://github.com/foo290/Agness-Bot/blob/master/AGNESS_BOT/Settings.py'>settings.py</a>.

You have to give exact name of your roles for this to work.

```
ROLE_ALIASES = {
    'OWNER_ROLE': 'Owner',
    'ADMIN_ROLE': 'Admin',
    'STAFF_ROLE': 'Staff',
    'DEFAULT_ROLE': 'Member',
    'UNVERIFIED': 'Unverified',
    ...
}
```


* ```OWNER_ROLE :``` The name or the role for owner could be diffrent for diffrent servers, so for commands which are ```Owner``` Specific uses this role.
* ```DEFAULT_ROLE :``` The default role for user, like normal role which has minimal access to the commands.
* ```MUTED :``` This role has no access to read or send the message and assigned to users if they are being muted by the bot for a specific interval of time.
* ```UNVERIFIED :``` If the Joinig verification is enabled, this role is assigned to users when they first join the server and this role has very limited access to the server for example: unverified users can only see welcome and Rules channel. If the joining verification is not enabled, members will be assigned default role.
